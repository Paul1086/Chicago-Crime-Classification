## Chicago Crime Classification with Machine Learning


## Programming Platform:
* Python

## Used Libraries:
* Data Analysis and cleaning: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy 
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

In this project, machine learning (ML) concepts were implemented for determining the severity of the crime and also for the classification of the crimes. The ML algorithms that were implemented are:
<ol>
<li>K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)</li>
<li>Logistic Regression</li>
<li>Support Vector Machine</li>
<li>KMeans clustering</li>    
</ol> Among these 4 algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine are supervised learning and KMeans clustering is unsupervised learning. The reason and the significance for using each of these algorithms are described in the appropriate sections of this notebook.

The dataset that we are working with is mainly an imbalanced dataset. So, like any rare case prediction, implementing ML algorithms to classify crimes is difficult. 

Throught this notebook, each section is described before the implementation of the codes.
