## Chicago Crime Classification with Machine Learning


## Programming Platform:
* Python

## Used Libraries:
* Data Analysis and cleaning: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy 
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

In this project, machine learning (ML) algorithms were implemented for determining the severity of the crime and, also for classifying the crime. The ML algorithms that were implemented are:

* K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* KMeans clustering (Unsupervised)

The dataset that was used here is an imbalanced dataset (rare class - 3%). So, like any rare case prediction, implementing ML algorithms to classify crimes is difficult. To deal with the imbalanced dataset, undersampling, and oversampling techniquse were implemented. Althogh, the undersampling resulted in a poor performance, oversampling technique with class weight setting worked satisfactorily.
